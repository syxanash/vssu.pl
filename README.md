```

##Description

vssu.pl allows you to make a screenshot of your system
and upload it automatically on imgur.com using their API service.
This script uses also zenity for getting various data from the
user. It requires also the tool scrot in order to catch
the screenshot of your system.
Remember that you can also specify your own API key of imgur.com
simply by passing it as an ARGV parameter to --apikey.

##Installation

This script obviously requires the tools scrot and zenity, which can be
easily installed (if you're on a Debian-like distro), by the following command:

```sh
apt-get install scrot zenity
```

otherwise if you're using a different distro, these tools will probably
be listed into the relative package manager.

You also need various Perl modules to make this script work, here's the list:

* [MIME::Base64](http://search.cpan.org/~enrys/POD2-IT-Getopt-Long/lib/POD2/IT/Getopt/Long.pm) -- (already installed)
* [File::Slurp](http://search.cpan.org/~uri/File-Slurp-9999.19/lib/File/Slurp.pm) -- (installation required)
* [LWP::UserAgent](http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/libwww-perl-6.04/lib/LWP/UserAgent.pm) -- (already installed)
* [JSON](http://search.cpan.org/~makamaka/JSON-2.53/lib/JSON.pm) -- (probably installation required)
* [Getopt::Long](http://search.cpan.org/~enrys/POD2-IT-Getopt-Long/lib/POD2/IT/Getopt/Long.pm) -- (probably installation required)
* [Pod::Usage](http://perldoc.perl.org/Pod/Usage.html) -- (already installed)
* [version](http://search.cpan.org/~jpeacock/version-0.99/lib/version.pod) -- (already installed)

File::Slurp and JSON are also contained into the Ubuntu synaptic system so, just type the command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libfile-slurp-perl libjson-perl
```

if you need to install them.
